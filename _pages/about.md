I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Division of Emerging Interdisciplinary Areas](https://emia.hkust.edu.hk) at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). Prior that, I spend two years at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, as an assistant professor. I recevied my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) under the supervison of [Prof. Chaoli Wang](https://sites.nd.edu/chaoli-wang/). I received my master's degree in Computer Software and Theory and my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. Both from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn).



Students interested in joining my group starting in fall 2025 and 2026 should apply to the [Department of Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/graduate/prospective). More on [this page](/joining).
