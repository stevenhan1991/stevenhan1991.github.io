I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Division of Emerging Interdisciplinary Areas](https://emia.hkust.edu.hk) at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). Prior that, I spend two years at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, as an assistant professor. I recevied my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) under the supervison of [Prof. Chaoli Wang](https://sites.nd.edu/chaoli-wang/). I received my master's degree in Computer Software and Theory and my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. Both from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn).

<h1 id='research'>Research</h1>
My research lies at the intersection of scientific visualization, human-computer interaction, and machine learning. Scientific simulations generate vast amounts of volumetric data essential for understanding various natural phenomena. My work seeks to address key challenges, such as:
<ul>
<li> <span style="color: #0067B1; font-weight: bold;"> How can we develop algorithms to efficiently manage large-scale simulation data? </span> Representative papers include <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10371224/'>KDINR</a> and <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9852325/'>CoordNet</a> </li>
<li> <span style="color: #DC5541; font-weight: bold;"> How can we design generative models to rapidly produce scientific data? </span> Representative papers include <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9230431/'>V2V</a> and <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552857/'>STNet</a> </li>
<li><span style="color: #B86CE4; font-weight: bold;"> How can we build intelligent, interactive systems that empower domain scientists to explore and visualize volumetric data for better decision-making and deeper insights? </span> Representative papers include <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8532319' >FlowNet</a> and DTBIA </li>
</ul>
The goal of my research is to answer these questions.
